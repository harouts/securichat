Securichat is a secure messaging application for Android. It uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that your message is not only encrypted in transit, but also at rest in the database. With privacy concerns growing larger everyday, messaging through Securichat will make sure no one but your intended recipient will be able to read your message.
